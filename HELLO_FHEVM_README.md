## 🔐 Privacy Features

### Anonymous Donations

- **Identity Protection**: Donor addresses can be hidden using address(0)
- **Amount Encryption**: Donation amounts encrypted using FHE simulation
- **Selective Privacy**: Users choose between public and anonymous donations
- **Transparent Totals**: Campaign progress visible without revealing sources

### FHEVM Integration

- **Encryption Simulation**: Demonstrates FHE concepts for learning
- **Real-World Ready**: Architecture prepared for actual FHEVM networks
- **Privacy by Design**: Built with privacy as a core feature, not an afterthought
- **Educational Focus**: Clear explanations of when and why to use encryption
